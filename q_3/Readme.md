To compile and run the file:

1-Go to the command line and type : make
2-In the terminal, write: sudo ./policy "policy_number" "priority_number" and press enter.
    Example of instruction : sudo ./policy 5 0
3- The code runs with a infinte loop (if you want to check in another terminal that the policy and priority of the pid actually changed).
So if you want to end the code ,go to the terminal and press ctrl+c then write in the terminal : make clean
